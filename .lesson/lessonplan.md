# Project 01: Romino's Pizza
## Learning Objectives
1. Students will be able to consolidate the skills of UX design on a command line, validation of data entry and automatic calculation of values
2. Students will work through the aspects of decomposition with some guidance in terms of the expected skills
3. Students will have experience developing a substantial project in the style of the NEA assignments
 
## Overview
Whilst this project is built on the consolidation of skills, and aspects of spaced practice, that are important for long term retention of skills learning, it is also an opportunity for the students to design and develop a relatively free brief - so *please* encourage them to extend where they can, implement their cool ideas because this is the differentiating factor between A and A* grades.

Students *will* get stuck. Work 1:1 with them to model and support them to get past the road blocks, at this stage it is more important for them to see the process of working through and solving a problem than it is for them to be entirely self sufficient. Give them time to be stuck, encourage them to be stuck and try and unstick themselves. Remember: In the NEA you won't be able to help, so start to simulate this experience now.

## Delivering the content in class

1. ***Plan*** Encourage the students to think through each *chunk* of the build, starting with the menu ask them to plan out what options they'll need, how it's going to look, timings, etc. before sitting down to build. Encourage them to see the benefits of this - particularly when they get onto the validation and calculation process.

2. ***Build*** Get the students to build one *chunk* at a time, so start with the menu - allow them to go back to their exercise work and previous code if they need to but encourage them to do as much from memory as they can; constantly remind the students that they will be without internet or research material in the NEA controlled conditions and they will need to be *off book* by then.

3. ***Test*** Ask student to provide testing evidence that what they've built works, discuss the classic *valid*, *invalid* and *extreme* testing strategies as well as *usability* testing. Students should get used to documenting this testing as it forms part of the evidence gathering for NEAs.
